        <p>Aligning Education, Technology, and Waste Management with Sustainable Development Goals</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Education Sector</h2>
        <p>The Education Sector plays a crucial role in sustainable development by ensuring that all individuals have
            access to quality education, which leads to better opportunities, empowerment, and overall societal
            progress. The sector aligns with the following SDGs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG Target 4.1:</strong> Ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men
                and women, achieve literacy and numeracy. <br>This target focuses on literacy and numeracy, the
                foundation for personal development and economic participation.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Indicator 4.1.1:</strong> Proportion of youth and adults who have achieved at least a
                minimum level of proficiency in literacy and numeracy, by sex. <br>This indicator measures progress
                towards achieving the target of universal basic education.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Target 4.4:</strong> Increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills for
                employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. <br>This target emphasizes access to skills training,
                which is vital for economic development.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Indicator 4.4.1:</strong> Proportion of youth and adults with ICT skills, by sex. <br>In
                today's world, digital literacy is essential for accessing the job market and participating in the
                global economy.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Technological Sector</h2>
        <p>The Technological Sector is essential for driving innovation, improving efficiency, and addressing global
            challenges. By focusing on technological development and research, this sector contributes to building
            sustainable infrastructure and improving overall societal welfare. The sector aligns with the following
            SDGs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG Target 9.5:</strong> Enhance scientific research, upgrade technological capabilities, and
                foster innovation. <br>Technology plays a significant role in developing new solutions to global
                challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Indicator 9.5.1:</strong> Research and development expenditure as a proportion of GDP.
                <br>This indicator tracks the financial investment in research and development, reflecting a nationâ€™s
                commitment to technological progress.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Target 9.4:</strong> Upgrade infrastructure and retrofitting industries to make them
                sustainable. <br>This focuses on improving energy efficiency and adopting environmentally friendly
                technologies in industries.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Indicator 9.4.1:</strong> CO2 emission per unit of value added. <br>This indicator tracks
                industries' carbon emissions in relation to their economic output, promoting sustainability in
                industrial practices.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Waste Management</h2>
        <p>Effective waste management is crucial for sustainable urban development. By reducing, recycling, and properly
            managing waste, we can reduce environmental pollution and promote cleaner, healthier cities. The Waste
            Management sector aligns with the following SDGs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SDG Target 12.4:</strong> Achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and all waste.
                <br>This target ensures that waste management systems prioritize environmental health and safe disposal
                methods.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Indicator 12.4.2:</strong> Hazardous waste generated per capita and proportion of hazardous
                waste treated. <br>This indicator tracks how well cities handle dangerous waste, ensuring proper
                treatment and disposal.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Target 11.6:</strong> Reduce the environmental impact of cities by improving waste
                management systems. <br>Efficient waste management systems reduce pollution, improve urban health, and
                contribute to the overall livability of cities.</li>
            <li><strong>SDG Indicator 11.6.2:</strong> Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with
                adequate final discharge. <br>This indicator measures how effectively waste is collected and disposed of
                in urban areas, aiming for a clean and sustainable environment.</li>
        </ul>
